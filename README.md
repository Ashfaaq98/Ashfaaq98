I'm Ashfaaq, and I operate at the cutting edge of **Cyber Security** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

My focus is on building intelligent systems – specifically designing and developing **multi-agent LLM applications** tailored to tackle complex cybersecurity challenges.

Here on GitHub, you'll find some of my projects exploring these intersections.
