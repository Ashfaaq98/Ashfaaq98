Hi there! 👋

I'm Ashfaaq, and I operate at the cutting edge of **Cyber Security** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

My focus is on building intelligent systems – specifically designing and developing **multi-agent LLM applications** tailored to tackle complex cybersecurity challenges. Think enhanced **threat detection and response** capabilities powered by AI.

Beyond building defenses, I'm deeply interested in understanding the full spectrum of AI's impact on security. That's why I actively **research and write about the offensive security implications of Generative AI**, exploring how these powerful tools might be leveraged and how we can prepare.

Here on GitHub, you'll find some of my projects exploring these intersections.
